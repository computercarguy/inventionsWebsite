# Inventions Website
This is the website I built to showcase some of my inventions.

I initially wrote this site many years ago.  Recently, I became unemployed, so I could move to Las Vegas, and decided that I needed to not only add to my GitHub account, but also show that I have grown in my programming.  At first, I was just going to refactor the site. Once I got into it, I realized it needed a full rewrite.

So, I've added my old code to this repo for you to groan over as well as my updated code.  It's not perfect, but it's considerably better.  As time passes, I may decide to refactor this again to add a database for my content as well as get rid of any security issues this has.
