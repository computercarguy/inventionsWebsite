The main contact there was Jonah Brucker-Cohen from <a href="http://www.coin-operated.com/" target="_blank">Coin-Operated.com</a> and he had a <a href="http://www.coin-operated.com/coinop29/2010/05/02/drawbot-2001/" target="_blank">DrawBot</a> that I thought was the idea of the workshop: build other drawing robots.</td>

    	<td class="left">I found a toy battle bot that had a wired remote and arms that rotated around the main body.  There were places for armor or weapons to be attached and fall off as it did battle with the matching toy next to it, as well as the permanent tapered cylinder arms.  I took one of the robots I found, stripped off the carapace and decided to make it autonomous.  I was going to take markers to the ends of the arms of the Rotating Toy, after I made the toy autonomous.  This was a real simple toy to drive, so that as you backed up, it turned.  I had the toy go in "reverse" so it would always turn, so I thought it would make a nice circle path while the markers rotated around, making a weaved pattern.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">As it turns out, the large piece of paper wasn't nearly big enough for the huge circle this drove in nor did it go in a perfect circle, which I found out when doing a test run before adding the markers.  That test run ended up being the only run, too, since I didn't end up adding the markers.  I didn't want to mess up the floor or have to clean up afterwards.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">The real purpose of this <a href="http://www.scrapyardchallenge.com/" target="_blank">ScrapYard Challenge</a> was to make an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_musical_instrument" target="_blank">electronic musical instrument</a>.  As I was trying to build a second project, a 3 year old little girl and her mother came in.  The mother told me later that her daughter followed the Rotating Toy for about 3 hours.  The little girl would just follow it around the floor, pick it up and right it when it fell over, or get it out of tight spaces when it got stuck.  As a by-product of it being a battle bot and me not adding markers, it turns out it was very adept at getting out of corners and going around obstacles, due to the rotating arms.  As a drawbot, it was a moderate failure, unless there was a room with paper covering the whole floor, but as an obstacle avoidance robot, it was a moderate success.  Also, as a babysitter, it was a total success.  The mother wanted to buy it from me right then and there.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">I didn't know that the projects that each person completed at the <a href="http://www.scrapyardchallenge.com/" target="_blank">ScrapYard Challenge</a> were free to take home, so I declined the offer.  I now am working on building two new versions, so that I can be talking about the one I have in my hand while there are two others driving around, being working demonstration examples.  Unfortunately, I don't know what the original toy was called, so I have to make the new versions differently.</td>
