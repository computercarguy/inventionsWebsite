As for cutting the parts, I would generally spend around 2 hours cutting a bunch of pieces for several components at once, so I could basically assembly line things.</td>

They would learn how joints act, how complex the general human form is, and they would have the option to add their own motors, actuators, or cables to make their own robots.  This would make a very good science project and would probably win more than a few awards.</td>

According to <a href="androidworld.com/prod01.htm" target="_blank">Android World's website</a>, there are just over 100 reasonably serious android research departments in the world, and only 10 of them are based here in the USA, and most of them are universities.

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">We teach our kids technology, how to build industrial robots, and then ship lots of jobs outside the country.  This is counter productive on many levels.  But since androids, and humanoid robots in general, is a new market, we can get back in the race for technology here, rather than try to play catch up with everything else.  Then again, many of the androids in development now by other countries are way ahead of us anyway.  From what I've seen on <a href="androidworld.com/prod01.htm" target="_blank">Android World's website</a>, <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/robots.html" target="_blank">MIT</a> has very advanced 2 half androids, but no full android.  <a href="http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp" target="_blank">NASA and GM</a> have a nice robot that is the upper half of an android, but it's not a full android.  I've heard rumors they are developing legs for it, but it's not on their site.  The only full android I see in the USA right now is <a href="futurebots.com/walk.htm" target="_blank">ATOM-7xp</a>, from <a href="futurebots.com" target="_blank">FutureBots</a>.</td>
