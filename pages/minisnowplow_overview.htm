		<td class="left">Several years ago, I was going to work in the early morning while it was snowing hard and after it had been snowing hard all night.  I was on the highway going about 30 mph when I came upon a lot of even slower moving traffic.  Me being impatient and still needing to get across town, I started passing this long line of cars.  As I get near the beginning of the line, I realize they are following a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;q=county+snow+plow&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=county+snow+plow&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-mS8&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i5i24l8.2625l5725l0l6221l16l16l0l1l1l0l151l934l14j1l15l0.frgbld.&amp;safe=active" target="_blank">county snow plow</a>.  It was throwing snow all over the place, including back on the road it was trying to clear.  I'm not trying to berate the driver, because the wind was causing much of this havoc.  Since I hadn't gotten very far passing cars and needed to go a long way yet, I decided to pass the plow.  There was enough room, but there was no visibility near the front of the plow.  I was already white knuckling it, so I figured it couldn't be that much worse.  I was wrong, but I made it through.  All this time I was slipping and sliding around, but I'd driven through worse and could handle the millisecond by millisecond course corrections needed to make it past the line of cars, past the truck, and the rest of the way to work.  However, I do remember thinking, "There's Got to be a better way."</td>

		<td class="left" colspan="2">I don't remember how long afterwards that I decided to put a plow on the front of my car, but I started looking for something that would work.  I quickly realized there wasn't anything available for a car, and those designed for trucks were heavy, expensive, and would destroy my car as sure as landing in a ditch.  I also didn't want to plow the whole roadway, since that would also destroy my gas mileage.  Somewhere along the way, I decided to make plows smaller and lighter, and to put them just in front of my tires.  I realized that if the plow was only as wide as the tire, there would be the extreme likelihood that snow would fall back into the tire path, as well as that I would have to make the plow track with the tire.  I looked at how the front tire was mounted on my car and realized I could mount the plow, via an arm, onto the shock tower mount to make it turn into the path of the tire as I turned the steering wheel, and the plow could be made slightly wider than the tire without any serious drawbacks.</td>

		<td class="left" colspan="2">Once I decided to miniaturize plows, I started looking to see if there was anything I could work from, since it's usually easier to modify something already out there for the purpose I want.  Unfortunately there wasn't, so I started looking at how I was going to build it from scratch.  Once I had a design in mind, I realized I would have to learn how to weld.  I'd wanted to learn for years, and even though I've had my dad weld stuff for me at his workplace, I didn't want to do that this time.  There was no telling how long it would take to find a working design and one that would be simple as well.  As it turns out, I had the right idea the first time, but I ended up spending more money on welding gear than the parts for the plows.  I also spent a lot of time learning how to weld, and then learning how to weld so that after grinding, the pieces would still be attached to each other.  Talk about a learning curve, and since I didn't have anyone there to tell me what I was doing wrong, it took me a long time to get anywhere.</td>

		<td class="left" colspan="2">After many mistakes, some unrealized design issues, and a couple of coats of paint, I have the first set of snow plows designed to fit on virtually any vehicle and plow only the path of the tires during driving, and not for plowing sidewalks, driveways, or the whole roadway.</td>

		<td class="left" colspan="2">After thinking about this invention some more, I realized that there would be stuff that this wouldn't remove, such as ice and loose stuff around cracks the plow wouldn't be able to get to.  This meant that I had to put down some sand or salt for traction after the plow and before the tire.  So I did some more looking at my car, and the obvious open place for a container of sand to fit was the fenders.  I had to move some bracing, rearrange cables, find a new spot for the horn, and cut out some sheet metal that was in the way, but I was able to hollow out enough space for a several gallon container to fit in each of my fenders.  I used fencing wire to make a wire frame to work from and made two containers from sheet metal to fit those spaces.</td>

		<td class="left" colspan="2">This starts the process of designing the Mini Sand Spreaders.  I noticed that these containers had lots of corners, curves, and anything but straight sides, so I decided to put an unbalanced motor on them, to clear clogs and loosen packed material.  I also put a deflector at the bottom and hooked it to the arm of the Mini Snow Plow so that it would always put the sand, salt, or whatever, down on only the cleared path and only the width of the cleared path.  Granted, I didn't put all of these items on the prototype, but those are some of the options I thought it would need.</td>
