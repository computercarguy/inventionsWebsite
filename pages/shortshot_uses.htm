It can basically be used for anything that kids need to learn about portion control.  Right now it's for liquids, but with a little refinement can probably be used for solids, such as salt, pepper, sugar, and whatever else comes to mind.</td>

    	<td class="left">These dispensers have more widespread use than just for kids, even though parents around the world would be interested in these products.  People who have muscular control issues, such as those who have multiple sclerosis, have had a stroke, or were seriously injured can use these products during rehabilitation.  Their caretakers can worry less about cleaning up messes, and the person being rehabilitated can be less frustrated about making those messes.  The caretaker doesn't have to hover as much or simply do it for their patient, and can allow their patient to have the freedom that is the ultimate goal of the rehab.  On the flip side, the patient doesn't suffer the humiliation of being "babied" and can feel more confident in their recovery, which in turn allows recovery to happen faster.</td>

This last definition could encompass those in mental institutes or those who were born with mental deficiency, such as Down's Syndrome.  Sometimes people in any of these instances can have tantrums or be mischievous.  Of course, everyone can have these moments, but regardless the reason, the Short Shot Dispensers will reduce the mess created when the havoc starts.</td>

This is my train of thought when I came up with these products.  Even if they do still use the Short Shot Dispensers in the food fight, there's going to be considerably less mess to clean, and simply by reducing the amount of mustard available, you're saving yourself a lot of staining potential.</td>

It could reduce the amount of condiments that are over used or wasted by customers, thereby reducing the cost of running the restaurant and cafeteria.  This means that the food can be produced at lesser cost, and can mean greater earning potential for the owner or reduced cost of the food.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">While doing the write-up for this site, I realize that there many types of food that can use this type of dispenser.  These dispensers can be used for a huge variety of food, just to mention one category.  These dispensers can be carefully measured portions for home or restaurant use.  Right now, people who have to worry about portions have to use measuring cups or a scale, sometimes a reference book to calculate calories for general measurements.  This is often distracting from the meal, or even too clumsy to be practical and the user may give up.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">The Short Shot Dispensers being used by people trying to limit their food intake would act as a buffer so that they would not only see the correct amount of food to eat, but it would also act as an easy way to measure the food.  These people could have these prefilled and then they can have the correct portions available whenever they need it, such as when they are rushing in the morning to get to work.  Many dieticians will agree that a large part of over eating is the mental aspect of seeing the correct portions versus just putting what a person thinks is the correct portion on their plate.</td>

Having an eating disorder can go the other way, so that someone trying to recover from eating too little would see the correct amount to eat and not be overwhelmed by a full box of cereal, for instance.  In this case, their goal would be not to eat that little of a portion, but to eat that much of a portion, which would be the correct portion regardless of needing to lose or gain weight.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">This would also be a way to not advertise to everyone that they are on a diet, since the dispensers wouldn't look significantly different from the standard container.  Co-workers and visitors wouldn't notice the difference, unless they were using the same system.  Another part of being on any sort of diet is the peer pressure that can sometimes be against it, so if you prevent people from knowing about something, they can't talk you out of it or simply make unkind comments about it.  Also, since it's in plain sight, it's not a secret.</td>
