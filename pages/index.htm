  	<td class="left">For instance, about 25 years ago, as a young kid making noises slurping the last few drops of pop out of a cup, I would get reprimanded to not be so loud.   I decided to cut a small slit in one end of the straw, which cut the noise generated by about 50%.  I never did anything with it.  A few years ago, I noticed that many straws now have a slit in at least one end.  It's not like I would have made any money off the idea, but it's one of many ideas that I didn't take anywhere.</td>

  	<td class="left">That is until now.  I am now looking to get some of my ideas "out there" so that I might be able to make money while, hopefully, solving people's problems.  Just like in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358082/" target="_blank">Robots</a>, I tend to work off the motto "See a need, fill a need."  Sometimes, when I see a problem, I end up coming up with a solution, even when others don't even notice that a problem exists, or they write it off as minimal or not fixable.</td>

  	<td class="left">I also try to live by the motto from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396555/" target="_blank">Meet the Robinsons</a>, "Keep moving forward."  It doesn't always work, but I try never to go back to an old way of thinking or doing when I find a new way.  This even goes to the point where I try never to buy a product that isn't as good or better quality than the one I'm replacing.  I also try never to repeat the same mistakes others make.  Like I said, this doesn't always work, but I try.</td>

  	<td class="left">When I'm at work, I usually try to find an easier, more efficient, and more effective way of accomplishing the same thing.  For instance, I was once doing batch scanning during a third shift job and to move the scans I just created, I would have to use a VBScript to move the files from my computer to a network location.  Unfortunately, this script wasn't designed to assist my specific job position, but was for another position that did a similar, but different, task.  I suggested to my manager that the IT staff make some minor changes to the script so that it would be geared towards not just my position, but to each individual job position.  When the idea was shot down and called impossible, I set out to do it myself, since I knew it was easily possible.  In about 30 minutes, I learned enough about VBScript to make the adjustment to the relevant 2 lines of code and I was able to boost the amount of work I did to exceed that of any other shift.  To put it simply, there were 4 people on each of first and second shift that did my same job and I was the only one on third shift.  I did twice as much as all of first shift, and one and a half times what second shift did, and I had an hour less to do it in.  My simple edit allowed me to speed up considerably while maintaining an average 100% accuracy, while everyone else was rarely over 90%.</td>

  	<td class="left">Two notes before you go any farther: I am not a professional photographer nor a professional digital photo manipulator, so don't judge what you see on this site by the poor quality of the photographs.  I am doing what I normally do, the best with what I have to work with and learning on the fly.  The second items is that the page will resize to fit your screen once it is completely loaded, so please wait for all images to load before trying to read anything, since it might not look very good until then.</td>

So far, these are the ones I have publicly displayed, and am actively looking for someone to either license or outright buy the product.</td>
