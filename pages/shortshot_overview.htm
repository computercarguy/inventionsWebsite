    	<td class="left" colspan="2">One day when I was over at his place playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero" target="_blank">Guitar Hero</a>, my best friend from high school told me about his kids painting the bathroom wall with toothpaste.  About an hour went by and I had this thought that there needs to be a way to limit the amount of toothpaste kids have access to, but still provide them enough to put on their toothbrush and do it themselves.  Later that night, in between sets, I figured out that if you took an empty toothpaste tube and put just enough toothpaste in it for the kid to use, then not only do you save yourself a mess to clean, but they don't realize they are being handed a basically empty tube.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">Minutes later, I figured out that if you take a full size tube of toothpaste and put a nozzle on it so that you can squeeze toothpaste from that tube into a smaller one, then you're good to go.  Then I came up with making the kid sized tube not just empty, but have a smaller chamber for the adult to fill.  This chamber not only tells the adult how much to put in, but also allows the kid to actually squeeze the small amount out normally.  So now you have a nozzle for a regular sized tube of toothpaste and a kid sized tube that is basically empty, except for a small pocket ready to accept and push out the toothpaste.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">It was a short jump from toothpaste over to ketchup, mustard, and shampoo bottles, since these are also items that kids need to learn how to use and usually end up making messes, either by accident or intentionally.  The same idea of a chamber inside the full sized bottle, but these other bottles are large enough to not need a nozzle.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">So then I needed a name.  Since it was sort of "short changing" the kid with less toothpaste, ketchup, etc., and it was a "one shot" deal, I thought "Short Shot" was a very apt name.  It not only describes a little bit about the product, but it's obscure enough that kids wouldn't really understand it without it being explained, or maybe even after it's been explained, and I hadn't heard of a product with that name before.  After some internet searching for a product with that name, trademark searching, and weighing the lack of options, I decided to stick with it, calling the whole series "Short Shot Dispensers."</td>

	<tr>
    	<td class="left" colspan="2">While I have had good response to these products, I have had some negative remarks about having to constantly refill the dispensers or buying "empty" bottles.  It's true that after each use, the bottles would need to be refilled, but I've considered having a completely full bottle or tube and having a mechanical or electro-mechanical means of limiting the usage.  I haven't come up with a totally acceptable alternate yet, but that's what a R&amp;D department can ponder.</td>
