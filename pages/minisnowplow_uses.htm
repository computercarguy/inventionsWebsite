    	<td class="left">Even though I designed them to fit on my mid-sized sedan, the Mini Snow Plow and the Mini Sand Spreader can be resized to fit almost any vehicle.  I figure that the first way I'm going to market these inventions is for emergency vehicles.  There is a story that I remember hearing years ago about an ambulance that needed to get out to a rural house to bring someone to the hospital, but had to wait an hour before they could get a snow plow for them to follow, due to the massive amount of snow on the roads at that time.  I don't know if this is true or not, but why chance it?  It's better to be safe than sorry, right?</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">Put these things on ambulances, squad cars, fire trucks, and even utility company vehicles so that they can get where they need to be.  These are the vehicles and people that often can't wait for a snow plow to give them access during an emergency.  When someone in the country is having a heart attack, they need to get to the hospital right away.  If a building has high tension electrical wires fall on it and start a fire, the fire trucks need to get there as well as the power company vehicles.  If a water main froze and burst, the water company needs to get there.  If some crazy idiot is playing pinball with their car, driving fast down the highway, the police need to be able to not only catch up to his maniac, but have the traction to get him off the road, without them losing control, too.  These can also be put on the personal vehicles of the large county, state, and city plow drivers, so they can get to work safely.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">This brings up other uses, besides those related to winter weather.  Even though they are called the Mini <b>Snow</b> Plow, and Mini <b>Sand</b> Spreader, they can be used for many reasons.  I have already mentioned that salt can be used in the Mini Sand spreader, but there are other uses for it.  It's true that much of the United States is affected by snow on a regular basis, and it's also true that every state of the Union has seen snow at some point, but why limit this to snow?  California, for example, has mud slides and forest fires.  My inventions can move mud and put down drying agent almost as easily as they can handle snow and ice.  Then the ash that falls like snow after a forest fire is even lighter than snow, so it'll move that much easier, even when there's enough to make a vehicle get otherwise stuck.  When it rains hard or floods, my plows can move a large amount of water from the tire path and help prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaplaning" target="_blank">hydroplaning</a>.  </td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">I'm sure that there are other uses, such as preventing flat tires on rescue vehicles after a tornado due to the glass, nails, and screws that could be lying everywhere.  There are lots of uses I won't have realized until someone else puts my inventions to the task, and that's what I want.  Take my inventions and use them for whatever you want, as long as it's safe.  I do it with other people's inventions and products, so I would consider it a credit to my ideas that someone likes them enough to find different reasons to use them than I can think of.</td>
