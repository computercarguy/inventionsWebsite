			built this, I'm going to let you know that I'm fat, out of shape, and frugal.	That said, 
			I wanted to lose weight, get into better condition, not spend much money, and do it while 
			still getting work done.	I've gone on bike trails, and they are boring.	Also, I have 
			lots of muscle and need to tone it down instead of make more muscle.	Going up hills, 
			accelerating, and going fast all make muscle, and I want to get lean(er) muscles so that 
			clothes fit right.	Even when I was 155 lbs, straight out of 5 months of Army Basic and 
			AIT training, I had to wear large clothes.	I had a 40" chest, 16.5" neck, and massive 
			legs.	I now weigh... let's just call it "a lot more" and I have much larger dimensions 
			because of it, of course.

			discomfort and sometimes pain of exercising, and still get work done.	I decided a 
			stationary bike that had a desk instead of handles would work perfect.	Now all I had 
			to do was build it.

			I would be using it right now as I write this.	Unfortunately, no I'm not.	I had an 
			exhausting week at work, and another one is probably coming up, so I'm not bothering.	
			I honestly don't know when I'm going to be using it next, but it'll be there when I have 
			the opportunity.	The day after I finished this project, I did use it, so it's not a 
			total waste.	Also, I burned a lot of calories while I was making it.
