    	<td class="left">Right now, if someone wants to develop an android, or otherwise humanoid robot, they have to design the shell, body, or frame before they even think about how they are going to attach the motors, servos, actuators, cables, or whatever, then as they are building it, they have to redesign the frame to make adjustments to fit the parts they chose.  With Ani: The Robot Chassis, designers will have much less work to do, since they will have the basic chassis to work with, and since it's an open framework, there's plenty of room for tools and fingers.</td>

With an aluminum version, the designer can easily drill, tap, bend, or otherwise manipulate the frame.  Once the design is perfected, they can put the specified changes into a more rigid, custom version and mass produce the robot for less money and with less development time involved.</td>

All of the joints are articulated, including the wrists, hips, and neck being able to rotate.  There is also plenty of room in the rib cage for full size computer components, so the developer can use any type and speed of computer to run the movements of all the joints.</td>

They will also want them for their own robotics classes, since they will no longer need to spend so much time on building every part.  They can cover the most interesting and useful aspects of robotics: the electronics, pneumatics, and hydraulics as well as programming.</td>

Anyone with a technical, mechanical, or imaginative mind will be interested in building something on their own.  With kits available, they can do more than just cobble something together at home to approximate the design.  Instead, they can build the actual frame.  What's cooler than building the exact thing you originally thought was cool?</td>

If I can provide these kits at a reasonable cost, then it means these garage inventors need fewer tools as well as have the materials provided in the right size and shape already.  This lets the financial outlay to be reduced greatly.  Then there's the factor that they don't have to buy everything all at once, not to mention the lack of being stymied by the age old question, "How do I build _____ with the materials I can get my hands on?"  Well, at least when building androids and humanoid robots.</td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">In the end, it really comes down to one age old question: "Why reinvent the wheel?" In this case it's a humanoid robot frame, but the question is the same.  Why does each inventor, business, college, university, and basically everyone have to take the time to design their own version of the human body during the initial design and testing phase?  Sure, some companies may want to differentiate themselves by using their own body, or they might need a different size for a specific purpose, but it doesn't have to be a requirement.  </td>

    	<td class="left" colspan="2">My design, Ani: The Android Chassis, is here to fill a need that will only grow as more uses for humanoid robots and androids are found.  Here's the thing, just like all technologies that are generally useful, there will be uses found.  With it being the beginning of advanced humanoid robots and androids, there is a massive potential for this market.  Also, any technology or support structure for the rising market is going to rise with it.  This means that the more people who want an android, there will be more companies to meet that need, and they will need to get their frames from somewhere.  I'm taking steps to make me that supplier. What are you doing?</td>
